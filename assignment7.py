# # Assignment 7
# 
# In [Assignment 6](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/PGE323M-Fall2017/assignment6/blob/master/assignment6.ipynb) we wrote our own implementation of least squares curve fititng functions using Numpy data structures and operations.  Of course, least squares curve fitting is a very common task in scientific computing and there are several robust curve fitting utilities in the [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) software suite.
# 
# Complete the class below by implementing the functions `fit`, and `fit_through_zero`. Use the [`scipy.optimize.curve_fit`](`https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.curve_fit.html#scipy.optimize.curve_fit) function.  This function takes a *function* as its first argument.  Use a `lambda` function defined within `fit` and `fit_through_zero`.  For the `fit` function, the `lambda` function will have the form
# 
# $$
# f(\phi, \kappa_0, m) = \kappa_0 + m \frac{\phi^3}{(1 - \phi)^2}
# $$
# 
# where $\phi$ is the independent variable and $\kappa_0$ and $m$ are the fitting parameters.  This function will need to be modified slighty for the `fit_through_zero` implementation.
